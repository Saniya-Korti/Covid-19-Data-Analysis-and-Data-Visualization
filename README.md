# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-and-Data-Visualization


- [x] The project is about analysing and visualizing the Covid-19 data. 
- [x] The dataset used is taken from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
- [x] I create two different excel files to analyse the data deeply i.e, CovidDeaths.xlxs and CovidVaccinations.xlxs 
- [x] The .sql file consist of sql queries performed during analysing the data.
- [x] I've used Tableau for data visualization.
